This is especially useful for beginners who want to learn the basics of quantum computing concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum measurement. Once a circuit is built, it can be simulated or executed on real IBM quantum devices directly from the browser, making the Composer a powerful and accessible learning tool for exploring quantum algorithms."
